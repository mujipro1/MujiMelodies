                    It is what it is now..
    We know each other but we're strangers
    We look at each other daily but pretend we never saw.
    We find them when they aren't close by, and when they are there, we ignore them.
    Life is choosing paths for us, the ones that don't meet ever, the ones we never wanted.

    <br><br>

    But somewhere at some point, I know, you felt the same for me as I did for you, and that
    was something I'm proud of, of knowing that you felt at least, pity that it wasn't meant
    to be the way I wanted but it's alright. I'll think of it as I was walking into a rush
   and suddenly hit someone, and stopped for a moment, lived that moment, forgot that I 
   was running too, but we had opposite paths, we had to run, we couldn't stop, we couldn't
    take a turn, we just ran, without looking behind. :(</p>
