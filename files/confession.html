                    I've always been amazed by the beauty of nature, how this massively big universe holds everything in it, how far are the stars from us and how big the universe itself is, and that is what makes me wonder that we are just tiny little creatures in this big universe, for a very short span of time we came here, so what's the big deal? Why not do do what's their on your mind, why not just believe in yourself and believe on Allah.. what's the point of thinking what people will say when actually nothing matters.. do you think someone really cares about what some person living in a small town in a small city did on a specific date in history? Or do they even remember? NO!
So whenever I'm stargazing (my favourite hobbies), the confidence of doing everything that I ever wanted just boosts up because this is all the time we have, on this small planet of ours.
<br><br>
That's why I'm here to express myself in the very respectable way possible, i gathered enough confidence to open up myself in front of you. It's human nature that you feel attracted to someone who has a positive vibe and whose vibe matches yours. When we became friends, I had a feeling that you're a perfect human being, knowing that no one is perfect but my heart and my mind were attracted towards your almost perfect vibe because it matched mine I would say.
<br><br>
I've always wanted to maintain a healthy friendship relation between us and never wanted to express my feelings of attraction towards you but I couldn't hold up to them anymore, in the hope that this will not affect our friendship or the whole group's chemistry in any negative way, i can just hope for the better and the best. You also know that I've expressed myself before as well but it was not the very appropriate way possible, that caused some misunderstandings and confusions between us, so the past year has been difficult for our friendship as well, but this time I think communication is more important than anything. 
<br><br>
Please don't allow your emotions to become a hurdle in our friendship. I'm not hoping or waiting for any replies or feedbacks, I just wanted to let you know that I somehow, willingly or unwillingly, care for you.
