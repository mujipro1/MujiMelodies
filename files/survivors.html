                    Life is something you cannot understand fully ever, people come and go into and out of your life, those people without whom you cannot imagine living or even breathing, slowly and gradually become so far from you that you don't even realise their absence because you are surrounded with new people at the same time who keep you busy, actually, the new people are not the cause of this change. It is you yourself who got their priorities changed and the people who were the most beloved to you got far away from you without you even realising. 
                <br><br>
                And when does one realises this fact that someone was there in their life but now they are gone is when they randomly scroll their contact list and find some name who used to be once at the top of the list but now are lost somewhere in the middle, or when they meet them totally random somewhere unexpectedly, 
                exploding the emotions that they once had for their friendship or relationship and looking into on another's eyes realising how they have been going away from each-other or probably both are at the same place but new people and the passing of time have come in between both of them. The experience might not be heart pleasing but provides one a sense of regret or satisfaction that either they were the cause of the separation, or they were the survivors of all this unwanted tragedy.
