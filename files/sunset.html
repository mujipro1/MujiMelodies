                <p class='my-3 text'>What relieves me the most is sitting on a bench, the sun starts 
                    to set infront of you, there are leaves fallen on the ground , 
                    the leaves that were once a part of the trees but their energy 
                    went down too, they lost their connection with the tree, and me 
                    seeing this calm peaceful time of the day alone, with some light 
                    music.<br><br>

                    With a slight guilt inside of being alone, like there could have 
                    been someone, but then its all you and the sun in front of you.</p>
